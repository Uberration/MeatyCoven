## Install

Coven is still an early local-first MVP, but the npm wrapper is live for supported platforms. The user-facing command is always `coven`.

Try the published package:

```sh
npx @opencoven/cli doctor
pnpm dlx @opencoven/cli doctor
```

Or build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OpenCoven/coven.git
cd coven
cargo build --workspace
cargo run -p coven-cli -- doctor
```

The release workflow publishes `@opencoven/cli` plus native packages for macOS Apple Silicon, glibc-based Linux x64, and Windows x64. Check npm for the current `latest` tag before making version-specific claims.

## Quick Start

New to Coven? Run the interactive menu first:

```sh
coven
# or explicitly:
coven tui
```

The menu starts with **Start here**, checks your local setup, and shows the safest first command to try.

Prefer copy/paste commands?

```sh
cd /path/to/your/project
coven doctor
coven daemon start
coven daemon restart
coven run codex "fix the failing tests"
coven run claude "polish this UI"
coven sessions
coven sessions --all
coven sessions --plain
coven sessions --json
```

`coven doctor` checks whether supported local harness CLIs are available. `coven run` creates a project-scoped session record, validates the working directory, and launches the selected harness through Coven-managed PTY execution. In a terminal, `coven sessions` opens a human session browser where you can select work and choose visible actions like **Rejoin**, **View Log**, **Summon**, **Archive**, and **Sacrifice** without copying IDs; use `--plain` for scripts or `--json` for client discovery.

Coven also provides a rescue loop for OpenClaw contributors and users:

```sh
coven patch openclaw
```

If OpenClaw breaks, Coven gives you a predictable repair room: choose a repo, choose a harness, get a verified patch.

## What it does

Coven is the local harness substrate for OpenCoven. It does not replace your coding agent, your UI, or OpenClaw. It gives them a shared room where project work can happen visibly and safely.

OpenCoven is an open ecosystem for persistent AI familiars: named agents with memory, tools, identity, roles, and continuity. Coven provides the local runtime layer for that vision: project-scoped sessions, harness-neutral execution, inspectable history, and explicit authority boundaries.

- **Project-root boundaries** — every launch is tied to an explicit repository/project root.
- **Harness-neutral runtime** — v0 focuses on Codex and Claude Code, with a clean adapter path for future harnesses.
- **Human session browser** — live and completed work can be selected, rejoined, viewed, archived, restored, or sacrificed without memorizing ids.
- **Attachable PTY sessions** — live work can still be replayed/followed from explicit CLI verbs.
- **Local daemon API** — comux, OpenMeow, and the external OpenClaw plugin can coordinate through the same socket contract.
- **SQLite-backed history** — session metadata and event logs survive daemon restarts.
- **Redacted logs by default** — event payloads are redacted before normal storage and API display; raw artifacts are opt-in, encrypted locally, and short-lived.
- **Rust authority layer** — launch, cwd, input, kill, and path-sensitive requests are revalidated in Rust.
- **External OpenClaw bridge** — `@opencoven/coven` is an opt-in plugin; OpenClaw core does not include Coven code.
- **OpenCoven package shape** — CLI wrapper packages live under the `@opencoven/*` namespace while the command stays `coven`.

## Commands

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `coven` | Open the beginner-friendly interactive menu |
| `coven tui` | Explicitly open the slash-command TUI |
| `coven doctor` | Detect supported harness CLIs and print install hints |
| `coven daemon start` | Start the local Coven daemon |
| `coven daemon status` | Show daemon health, pid, and socket path |
| `coven daemon restart` | Restart the local daemon and rebind the socket |
| `coven daemon stop` | Stop the local daemon |
| `coven run <harness> <prompt>` | Launch a project-scoped harness session |
| `coven run <harness> <prompt> --cwd <path>` | Launch from a cwd inside the project root |
| `coven run <harness> <prompt> --title <title>` | Set a readable session title |
| `coven sessions` | Open the active session browser in a terminal; print a table when piped |
| `coven sessions --all` | Browse active and archived sessions in a terminal; print all when piped |
| `coven sessions --manage` | Force the interactive session browser |
| `coven sessions --plain` | Force plain table output for scripts/copying |
| `coven sessions --json` | Print a JSON `sessions` array for clients such as comux |
| `coven attach <session-id>` | Replay/follow session output and forward input |
| `coven summon <session-id>` | Restore an archived session, then replay/follow it |
| `coven archive <session-id>` | Hide a non-running session from the active list while preserving events |
| `coven sacrifice <session-id> --yes` | Permanently delete a non-running session and its events |
| `coven logs prune` | Prune expired encrypted raw artifacts and old redacted event logs |

Session rituals are intentionally explicit. **Archive** is reversible and keeps the ledger. **Summon** brings an archived session back into the active list. **Sacrifice** is destructive, refuses live sessions, and requires `--yes` so beginners do not delete work by accident.

## Local API

The daemon exposes a small versioned HTTP API over a Unix socket for first-party and external clients. The current public contract is **`coven.daemon.v1`** served under the `/api/v1` prefix.

Coven's current auth posture is same-user local access over `<covenHome>/coven.sock`. It does not use daemon OAuth, JWTs, bearer tokens, API keys, or browser cookies; provider auth stays with the harness CLIs such as Codex and Claude Code. See [`docs/AUTH.md`](docs/AUTH.md) before adding a new client, dashboard, remote bridge, or browser-facing transport.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/api-version` | Read the active API version and supported versions |
| `GET /api/v1/health` | Check daemon health and metadata |
| `GET /api/v1/sessions` | List sessions |
| `POST /api/v1/sessions` | Launch a session |
| `GET /api/v1/sessions/:id` | Fetch one session |
| `GET /api/v1/events?sessionId=...` | Read session events |
| `GET /api/v1/sessions/:id/events` | Read redacted session events |
| `GET /api/v1/sessions/:id/log` | Read bounded redacted log previews |
| `POST /api/v1/sessions/:id/input` | Forward input to a live session |
| `POST /api/v1/sessions/:id/kill` | Kill a live session |

Treat the socket API as the product contract. Clients may validate for UX, but the Rust daemon remains the authority boundary. See [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md) for compatibility rules.

Default API log and event responses are redacted. Raw sensitive artifacts are not returned by broad endpoints and remain unavailable unless explicit local debug persistence is enabled.

Current stable contract: [`docs/API-CONTRACT.md`](docs/API-CONTRACT.md). `GET /api/v1/health` exposes the named contract `apiVersion: "coven.daemon.v1"` and machine-readable capabilities for client handshakes.

## Requirements

- Rust stable toolchain
- Git
- macOS or another Unix-like system for daemon socket / PTY behavior today
- At least one supported harness CLI:
  - [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)
  - [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
- Node.js 18+ only for npm wrapper/plugin package development

If `coven doctor` reports a missing harness, install or expose one CLI on `PATH`, run the harness once to finish local authentication/setup, then retry `coven doctor`:

```sh
npm install -g @openai/codex
# or: brew install --cask codex
codex login

npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude doctor
```

## OpenCoven integrations

- **comux** is the visual cockpit for agent panes and can consume Coven-managed sessions through the local API.
- **OpenClaw** integrates only through the external `@opencoven/coven` plugin package.
- **OpenMeow** can consume Coven session status, intake, or notifications as the desktop companion surface matures.

Coven is the room where harnesses run. The clients decide how to present and route that work.

## Contributing

See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** for the recommended local development loop, release checks, and OpenCoven documentation rules.

## Releasing

Releases are **driven by a signed git tag**. Source versions stay `0.0.0` in the tree; the tag name (`v0.0.17` → `0.0.17`) is stamped into the wrapper and native packages by `scripts/publish-npm.mjs` at publish time. The full operator runbook, including the one-time npm trusted-publisher setup, is [`docs/reference/releasing.md`](docs/reference/releasing.md).

Pre-flight locally (runs the secret-guard scan, packs the wrapper + native package, installs them into a throwaway project, and confirms the wrapper resolves and starts the native binary):

```sh
node scripts/test-cli-prepublish.mjs
```

Cut the release:

```sh
git tag -s v<X.Y.Z> -m "Coven v<X.Y.Z>"
git push origin v<X.Y.Z>
```

That single push triggers `.github/workflows/release-npm.yml`, which:

1. Runs the full Rust gate matrix (`fmt --check`, `clippy -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace --locked`, secret-guard scan).
2. **Refuses to proceed** unless the pushed tag is annotated and GitHub has cryptographically verified the maintainer's signature.
3. Builds release binaries for macOS Apple Silicon, glibc-based Linux x64, and Windows x64.
4. Runs `npm publish --dry-run` for every tarball as a final gate.
5. Authenticates to npm via **GitHub Actions OIDC trusted publishing** and runs `npm publish --provenance --access public` for the three native packages and the wrapper. Every published tarball ships with a provenance attestation linking it to this exact workflow run and commit SHA.

There is no `NPM_TOKEN` secret to rotate and no `workflow_dispatch` manual button — the signed tag is the only release lever. If the workflow ever refuses the tag, see [`docs/reference/releasing.md#recovering-from-a-refused-release`](docs/reference/releasing.md#recovering-from-a-refused-release).
