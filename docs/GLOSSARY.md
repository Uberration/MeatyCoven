# Glossary

## ACP

Agent Client Protocol. In this repo, ACP appears as an integration surface for external agent runtimes and OpenClaw compatibility. Coven itself is not an ACP implementation; the external OpenClaw plugin maps between OpenClaw runtime events and Coven sessions.

## API version

The compatibility version exposed by the daemon socket API. Current stable value: `v1`.

## Archive

Hide a non-running session from the active list while preserving its record and events.

## Capability

A discoverable daemon or adapter feature returned by `GET /api/v1/capabilities`.

## Client

Any process or UI that talks to the Coven daemon, including the CLI, comux, OpenMeow, or the OpenClaw plugin.

## comux

The cockpit layer for visible agent work, panes, worktrees, review, and merge flow. comux can consume Coven sessions but is not the Coven runtime.

## Control plane

The daemon layer that exposes capabilities and routes known action ids to owned adapters.

## Coven

The OpenCoven local runtime substrate and command-line product.

## `coven`

The user-facing command.

## `COVEN_HOME`

The local directory where Coven stores daemon/socket/database state when configured. Runtime state should not be committed to source control.

## Daemon

The local Rust process that owns live session state and the socket API.

## Event

An append-only record for session output, exit, or metadata.

## Harness

A supported coding-agent CLI that Coven can launch and supervise.

## OpenCoven

The broader ecosystem and organization around Coven, comux, and related integrations.

## OpenClaw plugin

The external package `@opencoven/coven`, which lets OpenClaw use Coven through the socket API. It is not part of OpenClaw core.

## Project root

The explicit repository or project boundary for a session.

## PTY

Pseudoterminal. Coven uses PTYs so harnesses behave like terminal-native tools while their output can still be recorded and replayed.

## Sacrifice

Permanently delete a non-running session and its events.

## Session

A Coven-owned record of one harness run.

## Socket API

The local HTTP-over-Unix-socket API exposed by the daemon.

## Summon

Restore an archived session to the active list and then replay/follow it.
