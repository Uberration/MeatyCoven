summary: "The Coven daemon is the Rank 0 authority for sessions, PTYs, and the local socket API."

  - Auditing what Coven validates vs. trusts from clients
title: "Daemon"
---

The Coven daemon is a single Rust process per host. It owns:

- Live session state and PTY lifecycle for every supported harness.
- The SQLite session ledger and the append-only event log.
- The HTTP-over-Unix-socket API under `/api/v1`.
- Capability discovery and action routing in front of adapters.
- Path canonicalization, project-root validation, and authority checks.

Clients (`coven` CLI/TUI, comux, OpenMeow, the external OpenClaw plugin) **never** spawn harness PTYs themselves. They ask the daemon.

## Where the daemon lives

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `$COVEN_HOME` | Root state directory. Default `~/.coven` on macOS/Linux. |
| `$COVEN_HOME/coven.sock` | Unix socket the daemon binds. |
| `$COVEN_HOME/coven.toml` | Optional config overrides. |
| `$COVEN_HOME/store.db` | SQLite session ledger and event log. |
| `$COVEN_HOME/logs/` | Per-day daemon logs. |

See [`$COVEN_HOME`](/daemon/coven-home) for the full layout and how to relocate it.

## Daemon control

```bash
coven daemon start
coven daemon status
coven daemon restart
coven daemon stop
```

`status` shows the pid, socket path, uptime, and the negotiated `apiVersion`. Use it before depending on the daemon in a script.

## Health handshake

Every client should begin with:

```http
GET /api/v1/health
```

The response includes:

- `apiVersion` — the named contract (`coven.daemon.v1`).
- `capabilities` — the discoverable feature set.
- `daemon.uptime`, `daemon.pid`, `daemon.startedAt`.

See [Capabilities handshake](/daemon/capabilities-handshake).

## Authority boundary

The daemon validates every request, even from local clients. See [Authority boundary](/concepts/authority-boundary). Clients are convenience layers, not trust roots.
