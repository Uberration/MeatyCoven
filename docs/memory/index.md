Memory is what turns a harness session into a persistent familiar. OpenCoven treats memory as a first-class concept with four layers:

  <Card title="Working memory" href="/memory/working-memory" icon="brain">
    In-session context tied to one PTY run.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Persistent memory" href="/memory/persistent-memory" icon="database">
    Cross-session memory that survives daemon restarts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Episodic memory" href="/memory/episodic" icon="film">
    Remembering specific events, turns, and outcomes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Semantic memory" href="/memory/semantic" icon="lightbulb">
    Embeddings and concept-based recall.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## How memory relates to Coven sessions

Coven stores **session events** — that is the ground truth for what happened. Memory is the layer above that derives, summarizes, and indexes those events for future familiars to consult.

  Session[Coven session events] --> Memory[Memory store]
  Memory --> Working[Working memory]
  Memory --> Persistent[Persistent memory]
  Memory --> Episodic[Episodic memory]
  Memory --> Semantic[Semantic memory]
  Familiar[Familiar prompt] -- recall --> Memory
```

The Coven daemon does not enforce a single memory backend. The memory layer is a client concern; Coven only guarantees the event ledger is durable and queryable.

## Search

[Memory search](/memory/search) lets a familiar query its own memory inside a session. The exact backend (sqlite-vss, lancedb, a hosted vector store) is up to the client.
