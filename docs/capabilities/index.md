A **capability** is a discoverable feature of the Coven daemon or one of its adapters. Clients call `GET /api/v1/capabilities` to find out what is available before they call anything else.

    `GET /api/v1/capabilities` — what is returned and how to use it.

    `POST /api/v1/actions` — send a known intent through the control plane.

## Capability record

```json
{
  "id": "desktop.automation.window.activate",
  "label": "Activate window",
  "owner": "adapter.desktop-use",
  "status": "enabled",
  "policy": "approval-required",
  "actions": ["window.activate", "window.focus"]
}
```

Records include:

- **id** — stable identifier.
- **label** — human-readable name.
- **owner** — the adapter that fulfils the capability.
- **status** — `enabled` / `disabled` / `degraded`.
- **policy** — hint for whether the action needs an approval prompt.
- **actions** — the action ids the capability accepts.

## Fail-closed routing

Unknown action ids fail closed. Adding a new capability is the only way to surface a new intent to clients.
