description: "Install Coven, run coven doctor, and launch your first Codex or Claude Code harness session in about five minutes from one local Rust daemon."
---

Install Coven, run `coven doctor`, and launch your first harness session in about five minutes. By the end you will have a running daemon, a project-rooted session record, and a working PTY attached to Codex or Claude Code.

## What you need

- **Rust stable** — only if you build from source. The published `@opencoven/cli` wrapper bundles binaries for macOS and Linux.
- **At least one harness CLI on `PATH`** — Codex or Claude Code today. `coven doctor` will report what is missing and how to install it.

<Tip>
Coven does not store provider credentials. Each harness keeps using its own local auth flow (`codex login`, `claude doctor`).
</Tip>

## Quick setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Coven">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npm install -g @opencoven/cli
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="From source">
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/OpenCoven/coven
        cd coven
        cargo build --workspace --release
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    <Note>
    Other install methods: [Install](/install).
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run doctor">
    ```bash
    coven doctor
    ```
    `doctor` checks the store, project boundary, daemon/socket status, and harness readiness. Follow its hints before continuing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the daemon">
    ```bash
    coven daemon start
    coven daemon status
    ```
    The daemon binds a Unix socket under `$COVEN_HOME`. Default: `~/.coven/coven.sock`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch your first session">
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    coven run codex "describe this repo"
    ```
    Or open the human session browser:
    ```bash
    coven sessions
    ```
  </Step>
