`coven` opens the interactive menu by default. The onboarding flow:

1. Confirms `$COVEN_HOME` and creates it if missing.
2. Runs `coven doctor` and surfaces install hints.
3. Asks for the project root and validates it.
4. Picks a harness (`codex` or `claude`) and verifies its CLI.
5. Suggests the safest first command.

See [Coven TUI](/start/coven-tui) for the slash-command palette.
