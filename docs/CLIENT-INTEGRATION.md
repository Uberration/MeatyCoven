# Client Integration Guide

Coven is a runtime substrate. Clients should present, route, and observe work without taking over the authority boundary.

## Integration rule

Talk to Coven through the local socket API. Do not duplicate Coven's path, harness, live-session, or deletion policy in a way that can drift from the daemon.

Recommended handshake:

1. Call `GET /api/v1/health`.
2. Confirm `supportedApiVersions` includes `v1`.
3. Call `GET /api/v1/capabilities` if using control-plane actions.
4. Use versioned `/api/v1/...` routes only.

## Client responsibilities

Clients may own:

- navigation;
- panes;
- chat or intake UI;
- task forms;
- diff/review surfaces;
- notification rendering;
- session selection;
- optimistic local UI state; and
- user approval UX.

Clients must not be the only enforcement point for:

- project-root boundaries;
- cwd restrictions;
- harness allowlists;
- live-session checks;
- destructive deletion rules;
- socket trust;
- external action approvals.

## comux

comux is the cockpit layer.

Good comux responsibilities:

- list Coven sessions;
- launch sessions from visible project/worktree context;
- open sessions in panes;
- attach/rejoin live work;
- show logs and artifacts;
- help review diffs;
- help merge, PR, archive, or clean up explicitly.

comux should remain useful when Coven is not installed. If Coven is missing, present clear installation and fallback states instead of assuming the daemon exists.

## OpenClaw plugin

OpenClaw integration belongs in the external `@opencoven/coven` package, not OpenClaw core.

The plugin should:

- register an optional Coven backend;
- validate config for UX;
- connect to the local socket;
- launch sessions through `POST /api/v1/sessions`;
- map Coven events into OpenClaw runtime events;
- preserve fallback behavior only when explicitly configured; and
- treat the Rust daemon as the launch authority.

The plugin should not:

- bypass the daemon for launches;
- depend on OpenClaw core internals;
- store provider credentials;
- assume unversioned routes are stable; or
- widen project-root permissions.

## OpenMeow and intake surfaces

OpenMeow-like clients are best treated as intake and presentation layers.

Useful responsibilities:

- capture user intent;
- show local status;
- present approvals;
- display notifications;
- hand work into Coven;
- show session updates from Coven.

Avoid making intake clients the automation engine. Reusable automation should live behind Coven capabilities and actions so the policy boundary stays centralized.

## Desktop clients and control rooms

A native control room can make Coven easier to operate by showing:

- active sessions;
- archived sessions;
- daemon health;
- project roots;
- harness availability;
- client integrations;
- capability catalog;
- action approval queue;
- logs and traces;
- docs and troubleshooting links.

The control room should still use the same socket API and capability handshake as other clients.

## Desktop automation adapters

Desktop automation is useful when an app has no clean API. It is also powerful enough to need clear policy.

Recommended pattern:

```text
user request
  -> client captures intent
  -> Coven exposes capability and policy hints
  -> client asks for approval when required
  -> Coven routes a known action id
  -> adapter performs the local UI action
  -> event/result returns to the client
```

Do not let UI clients bind directly to OS automation libraries and then call that "Coven integration." The reusable boundary should be Coven's control plane.

## Compatibility expectations

For every integration:

- use `/api/v1`;
- call health first;
- ignore unknown additive fields when safe;
- fail closed on unknown required behavior;
- test against representative daemon responses;
- update `docs/API-CONTRACT.md` when response shapes change.

## Error handling

A good client should translate daemon errors into action-oriented UI:

- daemon unavailable: show start/restart instructions;
- unsupported API version: ask user to update Coven or the client;
- missing harness: show `coven doctor` guidance;
- outside-root cwd: explain the project boundary;
- session not live: offer log viewing instead of live input;
- destructive action blocked: explain the session is running or lacks confirmation.
