# Troubleshooting Coven

Start with:

```sh
coven doctor
```

`doctor` is the fastest way to check store, project, daemon, and harness readiness.

## `coven` command not found

If using npm:

```sh
npx @opencoven/cli doctor
pnpm dlx @opencoven/cli doctor
```

If building from source:

```sh
cargo run -p coven-cli -- doctor
```

If you installed a native binary, make sure its directory is on `PATH`.

## Harness missing

`coven doctor` prints install hints for each built-in harness.

Codex:

```sh
npm install -g @openai/codex
codex login
```

Claude Code:

```sh
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude doctor
```

Then retry:

```sh
coven doctor
```

## Daemon unavailable

Start or restart it:

```sh
coven daemon start
coven daemon status
coven daemon restart
```

If a client cannot connect, verify it is using the same `COVEN_HOME` as the CLI.

## Stale running sessions

If a daemon stopped while sessions were running, those records may become `orphaned` on the next daemon start.

Use:

```sh
coven sessions --all
```

Then view logs, archive the record, or sacrifice it if it is no longer useful.

## Session does not accept input

Input only works for live daemon-owned sessions.

If the session is completed, failed, archived, or orphaned, attach works as replay/log viewing rather than live input.

## `cwd` rejected

Coven rejects working directories that resolve outside the project root.

Use a path inside the project:

```sh
coven run codex "inspect package" --cwd packages/cli
```

Do not use symlink tricks or parent paths to escape the project boundary.

## API version rejected

New clients should use `/api/v1`.

Check daemon compatibility:

```text
GET /api/v1/health
```

If the client expects a newer API than the daemon exposes, update Coven or the client so their supported versions overlap.

## `coven sessions` printed a table instead of opening the browser

Coven opens the browser only in an interactive terminal.

Force browser mode:

```sh
coven sessions --manage
```

Force table mode:

```sh
coven sessions --plain
```

## Archive, summon, and sacrifice confusion

- Archive hides a non-running session but keeps events.
- Summon restores an archived session to the active list.
- Sacrifice permanently deletes a non-running session and its events.

Use the interactive browser when possible:

```sh
coven sessions --all --manage
```

## Secret scan failure

Run:

```sh
python scripts/check-secrets.py
```

If it fails, remove the secret from the working tree. If a secret entered git history, rotate the credential before rewriting history or publishing.

Do not paste matched secret values into issues, logs, docs, or chat.

## Contributor checks fail after docs-only edits

At minimum run:

```sh
python scripts/check-secrets.py
git diff --check
```

For code changes, run the full gate:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked
python scripts/check-secrets.py
```
